A simple soup. It happens to be vegan.

## Special Equipment Needed

- Some sort of blender
- A grater

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon *Olive Oil*
- 4 cloves *Garlic*
- 1.5 lbs *Carrots*
- 1 small to medium *Yellow Onion*
- 2-3 *Spicy Peppers* (e.g. Serrano)
- 1 tsp *Salt* (more to taste)
- 1/2 tsp *Pepper* (more to taste)
- 1/2 tsp *Tumeric*
- 14 oz *Coconut milk*
- 14 oz vegetable stock
- 1 inch of *Fresh Ginger*

### Optional Toppings and Add-ins:

- Cilantro
- Scallions
- More Carrots
- Fresh Bread

## Instructions

### Mise en place

1. Get your carrots sliced in approximately 1/4" slices. Try to be consistent, but don't worry if they don't look pretty, they'll be blended into the soup. It'll be our little secret.
2. Chop the garlic into small pieces.
3. Dice the onion into small/medium pieces.
4. Prepare ginger by spooning the skin off and grating. Don't lose a finger if you can't grate the whole piece, just toss it in.
5. Slice the pepper. Remove seeds/pith to reduce spice level as desired.

### Cooking

1. Heat olive oil in a tall pot
2. Cook carrots with salt/pepper in pot for ~8 minutes, until nicely browned
3. Put in the onion, garlic, spicy peppers cook until translucent
4. Add the coconut milk, vegetable stock, ginger, turmeric to pot
5. Simmer until everything is tender (15-20 minutes)
6. Take off heat and blend it all. If the blender isn't big enough, do it in batches.
7. (Optional) Cook more carrots to add some texture to the soap

### Enjoy it

Top with anything you'd like. Eat.
